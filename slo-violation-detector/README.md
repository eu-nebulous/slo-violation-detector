# SLO Severity-based Violation Detector

## Introduction

The SLO Severity-based Violation Detector is a component which receives predicted and actual monitoring metric values, and produces AMQP messages which denote i) the calculated severity ii) the probability that a reconfiguration will be required and iii) the timestamp which we refer to.

The component can run either using a compiled jar file, or be packaged to a Docker container and run in containerized form. At a high level, the component runs through the following operational phases:

Operational phases
-----------------------

1. Initialization of generic execution parameters
2. Choice of operational mode (Detector or Director-Detector)
3. If the operational mode is Director-Detector then the following steps are carried out:
   - Initialization of the subscription to the topics the Director-Detector is responsible for
4. If the operational mode is Detector then the following steps are carried out:
   - Initialization of the internal structures representing the SLO rules and the monitoring metrics
   - Subscription to metric_list topic and initialization of new subscribers based on initial message
   - Subscription to topic_for_lost_device_announcement
   - Continuous calculation of Severity based on incoming realtime and predicted metrics, and creation of severity output messages when relevant input has been received. These messages may reflect a need for adaptation due to the values of realtime metrics (reactive reconfiguration) or the values fo predicted and realtime metrics (proactive reconfiguration)
   - Continuous monitoring of reconfiguration statistics and adaptation of the behaviour of the component as appropriate. This happens, by identifying for the last reconfiguration whether the proposed action was successful or not. The evaluate_correctness method is being used inside the process_slo_violation method, which is in turn used by the process_slo_violations method.


## Configuration

### Configuration file

The component comes with a configuration file which can be used to specify the behaviour of the component (eu.morphemic.slo_violation_detector.properties) and a configuration file which is used to configure the AMQP communication (eu.melodic.event.brokerclient.properties). These files are located in the src/main/resources/config directory of the project.

The principal configuration options to be changed before deployment are in the eu.morphemic.slo_violation_detector.properties file which is passed as a runtime argument to the component.  They are the `broker_address`(also the`broker_username` and`broker_password`), the `horizon`, the `number_of_days_to_aggregate_data_from` and the `number_of_seconds_to_aggregate_on`.

The triggering input of the SLO Violation Detector is a JSON message which informs the component about the SLOs which should be respected. The format of these SLOs is the following:

 \<SLO\> ←  \<Metric\> \<Operator\> \<Threshold\>

**Metric**: Any monitoring attribute which can be observed using the EMS can be used in the formulation of an SLO

**Operator**: Either greater than, greater than or equal, less than or less than or equal.

**Threshold**: We assume that metric values used in the description of SLOs are real numbers, so any real number which can be handled by Java 9 can be used.

Multiple SLOs can be joined using an 'AND' or 'OR'-separated syntax. Examples of AND and OR separated SLO's appear below:

#### A simple SLO rule

```json
{
  "name": "_",
  "operator": "OR",
  "version": 1, 
  "constraints": [
    {
      "name": "cpu_usage_too_high",
      "metric": "cpu_usage",
      "operator": ">",
      "threshold": 80
    }
  ]
}
```

#### A complex SLO rule

```json
{
  "name": "application_1",
  "operator": "OR",
  "version": 1,
  "constraints": [
    {
      "name": "cpu_and_memory_or_swap_too_high",
      "operator": "AND",
      "constraints": [
        {
          "name": "cpu_usage_high",
          "metric": "cpu_usage",
          "operator": ">",
          "threshold": 80
        },
        {
          "name": "memory_or_swap_usage_high",
          "operator": "OR",
          "constraints": [
            {
              "name": "memory_usage_high",
              "metric": "ram_usage",
              "operator": ">",
              "threshold": 70
            },
            {
              "name": "disk_usage_high",
              "metric": "swap_usage",
              "operator": ">",
              "threshold": 50
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The simple SLO illustrated above states that the “cpu_usage” monitoring metric should stay ideally below 80 (percent), otherwise an SLO violation should be triggered. On the other hand, the complex SLO involves the use of three monitoring metrics, “cpu_usage”, “free_ram” and “swap_usage”, which should be below 70 and 50 (percent)
respectively. The format illustrated in the second example has been devised to allow
nested AND-based or OR-based SLOs to be defined. The complex SLO rule states that if (cpu_usage>80 AND (ram_usage>70 OR swap_usage> 50))
then an SLO violation should be triggered.

### Building & Running the component

The component can be built using Maven (`mvn clean install -Dtest=!UnboundedMonitoringAttributeTests`). This command should succeed without errors, and verifying that all tests (except for the Unbounded monitoring attribute tests) are successfully executed. Then, any of the produced jar files (either the shaded or non-shaded version) can be run using the following command:

`java -jar <jar_name> <role_type> <configuration_file_location>`

In the above command, jar_name is the file name of the executable jar of the slo-violation-detector; role_type is a string - either DIRECTOR or DETECTOR; and <configuration_file_location> is another string holding the path to the configuration file.

When the component starts correctly it will not display any error logs, and it may also display that it listens for events on the topic in which SLO rules are to be specified (by default **eu.nebulouscloud.monitoring.slo.new**).

It is not mandatory to specify the <configuration_file_location> or the <role_type> but the defaults will be assumed (the location of the configuration file will be based on the `Constants` class and the role will be `OperationalMode.DIRECTOR` )

When debugging/developing, the component can be started from the Java main method which is located inside the src/runtime/Main.java file.

### Testing process

To test the functionality of the component - provided that a working ActiveMQ Broker / Event Management System (EMS) installation is available, the following steps should be followed:

1. Send a message with the rule to be monitored (In production, the EMS translator is responsible to send this message, as well messages described in step 2. Messages described in step 3 are sent by the Prediction Orchestrator). Optionally, send a message to the `metric_list_topic` defined in the `Constants` class, with the metric boundaries (either before or after sending the rule message, order does not matter) for the metrics to be appropriately processed.

2. Create a monitoring metrics stream, sending at a monitoring topic some values resembling real monitoring values.

3. Create a predicted metrics stream, sending at a prediction topic values which resemble real monitoring values. If the predicted values are over the thresholds defined at Step 1, then an SLO event should be created. It is important to create predicted monitoring data for the same monitoring attribute as the one for which realtime monitoring data is generated.

4. Watch for output on the defined output topic (by default `prediction.slo_severity_value`). The output will have the JSON format illustrated below:
   
   ```json
   {
     "severity": 0.9064,
     "predictionTime": 1626181860,
     "probability": 0.92246521,
     "reason": "proactive_slo_violation"
   }
   ```

The structure which is used for realtime and forecasted settings can be changed as required. However, the code is required to be adapted to parse the related topics (see the values of the `topic_prefix_realtime_metrics` and `topic_prefix_final_predicted_metrics` in the `Constants` class)

### Development

#### General Remarks

Starting new threads in the SLO Violation Detection component should only be done using the `CharacterizedThread` class, as opposed to using plain Threads - to reassure that Threads are being defined in a way which permits their appropriate management (registration/removal).

#### Internal structure

Execution in the SLO Violation Detector component begins at the Main class, part of the `runtime` package inside the src/main/java folder. Immediately, following some basic initializations the character of the program is determined - either Director-Detector or simple Detector - and then the relevant subcomponents are initialized. If the component is initialized as a Director-Detector, it will also have some active Spring Boot endpoints using which, it will be able to listen to incoming requests and provide information. The way this information is provided, is detailed in the Director and the Detector `RequestMapping` classes inside the `runtime` package.

Generic constants which should be available throughout the program, are included in the `Constants` class inside the `configuration` package.

The `communication` package includes the AttributeSubscription class which manages the subscription to all metrics (or attributes) which are included in a particular SLO rule.

The `slo_rule_modelling` package includes classes which are important to setup the methods in which Severity calculations are described for different kinds of rules. Inside it are the important SLORule and SLOSubRule classes.
The heart of the SLO Violation Detector is inside the `slo_violation_detector_engine` package, which contains the specific subcomponent classes which describe the behaviour of the two subcomponents of the SLOViD: the Director and the Detector. Also, the `Runnables` class inside it, contains the all runnables and runnable-like classes which do not tightly belong to their surrounding code. Classes are organized in three sub-packages: the `director`, `detector`, and `generic` sub-packages, which include classes specific to the director subcomponent, the detector subcomponent and all subcomponents, respectively.

The `utilities` subpackage contains miscellaneous utility classes which undertake miscellaneous tasks, including the SLOViolationCalculator class which performs the actual severity calculations. Similarly, the `utility_beans` package contains classes designed to model individual aspects of the behaviour of the component.


The `src/main/resources` folder contains files which are either used at runtime to fetch resources necessary for the proper execution of the program, or files which help with the testing of the component. Most notable are the property files under the config folder which directly impact the behaviour of the program, and the application.properties file which include parameters which regulate the execution of the Spring Boot part of the component (if a director component is spawned).

The `src/test` folder contains miscellaneous tests which are useful to verify the correct behaviour of the component.


### Docker container build

To run the component in Dockerized form, it is sufficient to build the Dockerfile which is included at the root of the project. When running the docker container, the configuration file which will be used is the `src/main/resources/config/eu.morphemic.slo_violation_detector.properties` file, relative to the root of the project (this location specified as a variable in the `configuration.Constants` class). If another configuration file needs to be used, then it should be mounted over the `/home/src/main/resources/config/eu.morphemic.slo_violation_detector.properties` location.

To start the component, docker run can be used:

`docker run <container_name>`
